ompare Strings

You have been given two strings, A and B (of length N each) and Q queries.
The strings contain only 0s and/or 1s.

For every query, you are given an index i. You have to update the value at index i to 1 in string B and check if B is lexicographically equal to or larger than A or not.
If yes, then print "
" and if not, print "

" (without quotes).

Input format

    First line contains two space-separated integers N and Q.
    Next line contains the string A.
    Next line contains the string B.
    Next Q lines contains an integer i (1 - based indexing)
