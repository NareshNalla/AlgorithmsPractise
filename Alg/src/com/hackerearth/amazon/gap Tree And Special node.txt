Given a rooted undirected tree T consisting of N nodes with 1 as the root of the tree. Each node of the tree has a value associated with it, where the value of the ith node is A[i]. A node x is said to be special if the path from the root to node x contains all distinct values. Your task is to find the number of special nodes.

Input:

The first line contains an integer N denoting the number of nodes in the tree.

Next line contains N space separated integers where the ith integer denotes A[i].

Next N-1 lines consist of two space-separated integers u and v, denoting that there is an edge between node u to node v.

Output:

Print a single integer, denoting the number of special nodes in the tree.

Constraints:

1 2
1 3
2 4
2 5
3 6
3 7

Sample Output

5

Explanation

Path from node 1 to node 1 contains: [1]

The path from node 1 to node 2 contains: [1, 7]

The path from node 1 to node 3 contains: [1, 2]

The path from node 1 to node 4 contains: [1, 7, 3]

The path from node 1 to node 5 contains: [1, 7, 7]

The path from node 1 to node 6 contains: [1, 2, 2]

The path from node 1 to node 7 contains: [1, 2, 5]

Hence, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 are special nodes.
