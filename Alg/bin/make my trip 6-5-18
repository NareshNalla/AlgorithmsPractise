Poisonous gas

You are in a battle field and your enemy has an army of N soldiers. Each soldier has a strength denoted by an array A. Your enemy will select some soldiers such that total strength of selected soldiers is maximum. You have a poisonous gas and you can use it on the selected soldiers as many times as you want. If the total strength is even, the poisonous gas will decrease the total strength of the selected soldiers to half of the total strength, otherwise it will not affect them. Your task is to tell if its possible to reduce the total strength to 1 or not.

 

Input Format:

First line contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases.

First line of each test case contains an integer N, denoting the number of soldiers.

Second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers, denoting the strength of the soldiers.

 

Output Format:

For each test case, print Yes if its possible to reduce the total strength to 1, otherwise print No.

 

Constraints:

Sample Input

2

5

76 56 -21 76 -45

2

8 -4

Sample Output

No

Yes

Explanation

Test case 1: n = 5 and maximum total strength is 76 + 56 + 76 = 208. You can not reduce 208 to 1 by using the poisonous gas.

Test case 2: n = 2 and maximum total strength is 8. First time when you will use the poisonous gas, total strength will reduce to 4. Second time when you will use the poisonous gas, total strength will reduce to 2. Third time when you will use the poisonous gas, total strength will reduce to 1. Therefore, the answer is Yes
Note: Your code should be able to convert the sample input into the sample output. However, this is not enough to pass the challenge, because the code will be run on multiple test cases. Therefore, your code must solve this problem statement.

2. Candies

You are given a string S consisting of lowercase English letters denoting different types of candies. A substring of a string S is a string S' that occurs in S. For example, "bam" is a substring of "babammm". Each candy costs 1 unit. You can pick some continuous candies such that you can create a palindrome of length K by using some or all picked candies. Your task is to find the minimum cost to create a palindrome of length K.

 

Input Format:

First line contains string S.

Next line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.

Next T lines contain a single integer K.

 

Output Format:

For each test case, print minimum cost as mentioned above. If you cannot create a palindrome of length K then, simply print -1.

 

Constraints:

Sample Input

babammm
2
2
5

Sample Output

2
5

Explanation

Test Case 1: You can pick candies denoted by "mm" and create a palindrome of size 2. So the cost will be 2 units.

Test Case 2: You can pick candies denoted by "babam" and rearrange them, "bamab", to create a palindrome of size 5. So the cost will be 5 units.

3. Bob And Array Queries

Bob has an array A[] of N integers. Initially, all the elements of the array are zero. Bob asks you to perform Q operations on this array.

There are three types of operations that can be performed:

     1 X: Update the value of A[X] to  2 * A[X] + 1.
     2 X: Update the value A[X] to 

A[x]/2 , where

    is Greatest Integer Function.
     3 X Y: Take all the A[i] such that  X <= i <= Y and convert them into their corresponding binary strings. Now concatenate all the binary strings and find the total no. of '1' in the resulting string.

Note: It is guaranteed that there is at least 1 type-3 query in the every test case. All the array elements will fit into 64 bit integers.

Input Format:
First line consists of two space-separated integers N and Q.
Next, Q lines consist of Q operations of either of the 3 types as described above.

Output Format:
For each type-3 query print the answer that is the no. of '1' in the resulting string.

Constraints:

 

 
Sample Input

5 5
1 1
1 2
1 3
3 1 3
3 2 4

Sample Output

3
2

Explanation

Initially, A=[0,0,0,0,0]

After 1st query, A=[1,0,0,0,0]

After 2nd query, A=[1,1,0,0,0]

After 3rd query, A=[1,1,1,0,0]

For 4th query, no. of '1' in binary representation of A[1]=A[2]=A[3]=1. So, answer=3.

For 5th query, answer is 2.
